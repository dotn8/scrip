# Notes

[ ] For some reason TEXT nodes choke on commas. The only place commas are used are in the table, which is a parser level rule.
[ ] Add support for double quotes and escaping in tables, so that cells can contain commas.
[ ] Strikeouts, normal dashes, and bullet points need to be differentiated better.
